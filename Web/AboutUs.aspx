        University of Moratuwa Alumni Association was formed in February 2013 by past students of alma-mater who are living in Perth, Western Australia. The first event organised by this society was sponsoring the 2013 New Year traditional pirith chanting ceremony at Kenwick Buddhist Temple in Perth. Many Moratuwa University graduates living in Perth showed an overwhelming response to the request sent by few who became the self-appointed organizing committee. Thereafter many enthusiastic past students volunteered to help to organize Moratuwa Alumni association activities which lead to the first ever get-together. Many group meetings were held at organizing members' residences. All who participated were full of enthusiasm to see their emerging society get a unique identity and welcomed by the Perth Sri Lankan community.

        After many meetings and meticulous planning, an invitation was sent to come for a get-together on 3rd February 2013. This invitation also outlined the mission, vision and objectives of this intended society. This inaugural meeting was held at Centenary Park, Wilson where BBQ was sponsored by the organisers. Elle matches, the Sri Lankan version of Base Ball, was played and kids were provided with a bouncing castle to make parents free to interact with alumni, as some of them met for the first time. The event was well accepted by all and many seniors including Moratuwa University's first graduates were present at this event. All who took part at this inaugural event have been very generous to bring and share food and drinks which is a tradition in Australia. Many past students representing all streams of study at Moratuwa University turned up to welcome the initiative taken by the organizers. Here the first meeting was held and first office bearers were elected with a mandate to launch the Alumni Society as a community group in Perth connected to parent alumni association in Sri Lanka. The event was a great success and all who came enjoyed seeing the opportunities ahead for the membership.
